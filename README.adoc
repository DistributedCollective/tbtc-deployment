= KEEP & tBTC local setup

== Setting up development environment
If youâ€™re on macOS, install Homebrew and https://github.com/keep-network/keep-core/blob/master/scripts/macos-setup.sh[macos-setup.sh] script to setup all necessary tools.

If you are not on macOS or you don't have Homebrew, you need to install:

- Go compiler, at least 1.14
- Geth (Ethereum client), at least 1.9.12
- Solidity, at least 0.5.17
- Truffle, at least 5.1.18
- Protobuf compiler, at least 3.11.4
- `protoc-gen-gogoslick` toolchain
- `jq`

Regardless you use `macos-setup.sh` or not, you should also install:

- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv], at least 1.2.18
- https://github.com/pypa/pipenv[pipenv], at least 2018.11.26

== Node.js version notice

Please use Node `v11.15.0` for everything but E2E test script.
To run the test script, please use Node `v14.3.0`.

== VPN connection

In order to install and run the system, you should be connected to the
`keep-dev` VPN. This requirement is here because we use a bitcoin
testnet node which is hosted on the `keep-dev` cluster. We plan to use
a local bitcoin network soon so this requirement will be abolished.

== Installing the system
. Initialize local `geth` using:
+
```
./initialize-geth.sh
```
+
You can skip this step if your local geth is already initialized. This script clears all Ethereum client data, initilizes genesis block, and funds five accounts. All client data are kept in the working directory of this project so all the data used for other projects stay untouched.

. Run local `geth` node using:
+
```
./run-geth.sh
```
. Run Keep & tBTC installation script:
+
```
./install.sh
```
+ 
This script will fetch `keep-core`, `keep-ecdsa`, and `tbtc` source code, deploy contracts of `keep-core`, `keep-ecdsa`, and `tbtc`. It will also build `keep-core` and `keep-ecdsa` off-chain clients.
+
Later on, if you decide to update `tbtc`, you can run just `install-tbtc.sh`. 
+
Keep in mind, `tbtc` depends on `keep-ecdsa` and `keep-ecdsa` depends on `keep-core` so if you decide to update `keep-ecdsa`, you can run `install-keep-ecdsa.sh` followed by `install-tbtc.sh`. 
+
If you decide to update `keep-core`, you have to run `install-keep-core.sh` followed by `install-keep-ecdsa.sh` followed by `install-tbtc.sh` or just the entire `install.sh` again.

== Run clients
The above installation script will configure:

- 1 `keep-core` client
- 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients

To run the `keep-core` client use:
```
./run-core-1.sh
```
+
It is enough to run one `keep-core` client to generate a group and produce relay entries. Setting up more than one client locally is possible but consumes more resources.


To run `keep-ecdsa` clients use:
```
./run-ecdsa-1.sh
```
```
./run-ecdsa-2.sh
```
```
./run-ecdsa-3.sh
```
+ 
There are at least 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients needed to open a keep. Setting up more than three clients locally is possible but consumes more resources.

== Beacon genesis

Before the beacon is able to produce a first relay entry, genesis needs to happen. Genesis triggers the first random beacon group selection.

Genesis should be triggered after `keep-core` client started with:
```
cd keep-core
KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD="password" ./keep-core --config configs/config.local.1.toml relay genesis
```

Bonded ECDSA keep factory from `keep-ecdsa` contracts requests for new relay entry to reseed after each signer selection but it is also possible to request for a new relay entry manually with:
```
cd keep-core
KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD="password" ./keep-core --config configs/config.local.1.toml relay request
```

== Relay maintainer

To interact with the system properly, you should also run a relay-maintainer
instance by doing:
```
./run-testnet-relay.sh
```

= How to interact with the system

You can interact with the system through the tBTC dApp or semi-automated
end-to-end tests. Before you start interacting, make sure you:

- Have a connection with the `keep-dev` VPN
- Installed all system components using `install.sh` script
- Have a local Geth instance (`run-geth.sh`) working
- Have a working relay maintainer (`run-testnet-relay.sh`)
- Have 1 `keep-core` and 3 `keep-ecdsa` clients up and running

== tBTC dApp

To run the tBtc dApp invoke:
```
./run-tbtc-dapp.sh
```
The application will be available on `http://localhost:3000`.

== E2E tests

To run the semi-automated end-to-end scenario invoke:
```
./run-e2e-test.sh
```
Please follow the emerging prompts to complete the scenario. Full automation
will be available in the future.
